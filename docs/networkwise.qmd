Statistics computed on the entire network - here, an induced subgraph of inhibitory neurons on ~150 nodes.

![High-level summary of changes in the network over time. Left: the number of edits in a given month over the course of proofreading. Edits are summed over the neurons in the induced subgraph. Right: The network change measures as the Frobenius norm of the difference between the adjacency matrices at two timepoints, i.e. the Euclidean norm on the difference in all edge weights.](result_images/induced_subgraph/n-edits-net-dissimilarity.png)
