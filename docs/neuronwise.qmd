## Proportion of outouts metric

### Historical ordering

TODO: show a gallery of example cells, ordering over time 

TODO: introduce the notion of taking the distance from the final

TODO: show some kind of summary statistics: 
    - Lineplots, one for each neuron
    - Some kind of vertical histogram - just not sure what the normalization here should be

### Artificial ordering

TODO: show a gallery of example cells, ordering with one of the artificial schemes

TODO: distance from final for the same neurons

TODO: summary statistic plot for all neurons

## Outputs by distance metric

TODO: same treatment as the above
